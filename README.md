Welcome to the **GameHub Store**, an interactive online shop for video game enthusiasts! This project was developed as part of the JavaScript 1 course assignment, where I utilized my JavaScript skills to create a dynamic and responsive store using data from the GameHub API. The store features dynamic content, user interactions, and a customized shopping experience.

## Overview

The **GameHub Store** is a project focused on providing an interactive shopping experience for gamers. The site fetches product data from the GameHub API and allows users to browse games, add them to a shopping cart, and check out. In addition to fulfilling the assignment's basic requirements, I implemented several extra features like a dynamic review generator, a similar games section, and multiple theme options, all aimed at enhancing the user experience.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to practice using JavaScript, API integration, and DOM manipulation to create a fully functional e-commerce site. I also wanted to add personal touches, such as random review generation and theme switching, to make the site more immersive and dynamic.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Product Display**: Products are fetched from the GameHub API and dynamically displayed on the homepage.
  
- **Product Filtering**: Users can filter games by genre or category, allowing them to quickly find the games that interest them.

- **Single Product Pages**: Each product has its own dedicated page showing detailed information, reviews, and a "similar games" section.

- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Users can add or remove games from their cart, with a visual indicator (e.g., green shopping cart icon) and a summary displayed on the checkout page.

- **Dynamic Review Generator**: For each product, a random review (name, icon, review text, and star rating) is generated dynamically to provide a more personalized feel.

- **Theme Switching**: Users can switch between "Day", "Night" and 6 other themes. The site also detects the user's device settings to apply the appropriate theme and remembers the user's theme preference throughout their session.

- **Trending Games and Sales**: A special section highlights trending games and games that are on sale.

- **Similar Games Section**: On the single product pages, users can view games from the same genre, adding depth to the browsing experience.

- **FAQ and Tabs**: I added collapsible FAQ sections and dynamic tabs for product details, making the site more interactive and user-friendly.

- **Dynamically Generated Breadcrumbs**: The site generates breadcrumbs for navigation on the product pages, based on the information retrieved from the API (though links are currently static).

## Usage

Users of the **GameHub Store** can navigate through the following pages:

- **Home Page**: Displays all products from the GameHub API, along with filtering options.
- **Product Page**: Shows detailed information about a selected game, including reviews and similar games.
- **Checkout Page**: Provides a summary of the games in the userâ€™s cart.
- **Confirmation Page**: Displays a thank you message after the user completes their purchase.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **API Integration** (GameHub API)
- **GitHub** (version control)

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, I developed skills in:

- **Working with APIs**: Fetching data from the GameHub API and dynamically displaying products.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to create interactive features such as the shopping cart and dynamic content generation.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing user-friendly error messages when API calls fail.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Leveraging `async`/`await` for API calls and ensuring loading indicators show up during async operations.
- **Creative Implementations**: I had the opportunity to be creative by adding features like a review generator, a theme switcher, and a "similar games" section, which made the site more interactive and engaging.
- **Project Reflection**: I realized that JavaScript is more challenging to troubleshoot than HTML/CSS. Despite some frustrations, I enjoyed how JS added a new layer of functionality and creativity to the site.

## Ideas for Future Improvements

- **User Profiles**: Iâ€™d like to allow users to customize their profiles with a name, wish list, icon, and theme preferences.
- **More Themes**: Expanding the theme options beyond the current modes.
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Iâ€™m planning to add more quizzes on the blog to make the site more fun and engaging.
- **Category Pages**: Create dedicated category pages for more specific product browsing.
